When you're new to coding or just new to Next.js, it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming just to take the first step of starting a project.

If you want to try your hand at building a web app but don't know where to start, this post is going to outline the steps that I follow when I'm creating a new Next.js project.

## Prerequisites

```tsx
// This is a code block
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

Before you can start a Next.js project, you'll need to confirm that you have Node.js and npm installed.

In your Terminal ( [how to open Terminal on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) / [how to open Terminal on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) ), run the following commands separately:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

You should get a response with a version number for each command. As of this writing, the current version of Node.js is v21.7.1 and the current version of npm is 10.5.0.

If you don't have Node.js and/or npm installed, you can follow the [instructions here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install them.

## Create The Project

Open your Terminal and `cd` into the directory where you want to initialize the project.

Personally, I use a folder named `/Code/benorloff` where I create my personal projects. I recommend having a dedicated folder for your projects, instead of creating them in `/Desktop` or `/Downloads`, for example.

Once you're in the directory that you've chosen, it's time to initialize the Next.js app.

### Create Next App

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

You'll be prompted to answer some configuration questions during the installation process. You can name the project whatever you would like, but I recommend using the answers below for the remaining questions:

- What is your project named? **(project-name)**
- Would you like to use Typescript? **Yes**
- Would you like to use ESLint? **Yes**
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? **Yes**
- Would you like to use 'src/' directory? **No**
- Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) **Yes**
- Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? **No**

Once the installation is complete, be sure to `cd` into the new project directory before continuing.

You can now open the project in your code editor of choice. Personally, I use Visual Studio Code.

### Install Shadcn/ui Components (optional)

I typically use [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as my UI component library, but you can skip this step and use a different component library or build your own components if you prefer.

If you want to use Shadcn for your UI components, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

After installation is complete, you should see 2 new directories ( `/components` and `/lib` ) and a new file (`components.json`) in the root directory of your project.

Your project structure should now look like this (`.next` and `node_modules` directories not shown):

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ button.tsx
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ card.tsx
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ form.tsx
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ input.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ label.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ next.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vercel.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ components.json
â”œâ”€â”€ next-env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Finally, let's launch our app so we can view it in the browser:

```bash
npx run dev
```

Open your browser and go to ```localhost:3000```. You should see the [Next.js boilerplate page](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-boilerplate).

Congratulations! You've officially launched a Next.js app ðŸ™Œ
