For Be Curious, I spearheaded the creation of a compelling brand identity and a dynamic website, reinforcing their unique position in the adventure travel industry. My role encompassed Lead Web Developer, Technology Consultant, and Designer, providing a comprehensive solution to align with their adventurous spirit and value proposition.

Leveraging WordPress, CSS, PHP, and Zapier, I designed and developed an engaging, user-friendly website. The project aimed to convey Be Curiousâ€™s adventurous spirit while maintaining simplicity and flexibility for diverse media applications. Key challenges included educating users about different travel styles, simplifying the search for scheduled itineraries, and enabling custom itinerary creation. To address these, I implemented a component-based UI, created custom post and field types with ACF, and wrote custom PHP to enhance WordPress hooks and functions.

The outcome was a significant sales increase, thanks to the direct booking capability integrated into the site. The streamlined process for creating custom itineraries, coupled with seamless integration into their CRM and syndication platforms, further amplified operational efficiency.
