I developed Bellhop as an all-in-one managed WordPress hosting solution. The platform streamlines WordPress management by providing a single vendor for maintenance, hosting, updates, security, ticketing and billing.

Built using Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Prisma, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, I architected Bellhop to cohesively integrate these technologies. The unified portal allows clients to easily manage their WordPress site, track updates, raise tickets and handle billing.

Bellhop's tech stack enables a scalable, maintainable platform. Positive user feedback validates the product vision of simplifying WordPress management for businesses.
