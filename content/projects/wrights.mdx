This project leverages the Spire API to seamlessly fetch and present inventory data through a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard. A key feature is its robust CSV import functionality, allowing users to efficiently upload and parse inventory data. The client-side import process includes comprehensive validation against the database schema, ensuring data integrity by checking for required fields (like part number and warehouse) and flagging any invalid field names. Specific data fields, such as product features and image URLs, are automatically transformed during parsing. User feedback is provided throughout the import via modals and notifications, culminating in a bulk update of inventory records. Built with a modern tech stack including Next.js for the frontend, Prisma as the ORM, Tailwind CSS for styling, and PostgreSQL for robust data management, it offers an efficient and intuitive way to monitor, manage, and update inventory levels.
