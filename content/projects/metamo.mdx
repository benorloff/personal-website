I worked closely with Metamo to bring their unique design vision to life in the creation of a new brand and website. My role encompassed the entire web development process, from initial concepts to finding and implementing technical solutions that would best showcase their brand.

Leveraging WordPress and its plugin ecosystem, I developed an engaging, user-friendly site with subtle animations and interactions. Where possible, I complemented this with simpler CSS to ensure a clean, lightweight implementation. A component-based architecture enhanced code maintainability.

Collaborating with the Metamo team, I strived to understand their aesthetic goals and translate them into an elegant digital experience. The bold typographic choices and minimalist design provide a fitting backdrop to highlight Metamo's offerings.
